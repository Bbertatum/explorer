The child will receive the object as its second argument to the message event.\n\nThis means that you won't be able to do things like:\n\n```javascript\nchild.send('message', {some: 'data'}, [data])\n```\n\n[List of accepted instances](https://github.com/joyent/node/blob/9010dd26529cea60b7ee55ddae12688f81a09fcb/lib/child_process.js#L436). If you look a but further in the code, internal messages are sent with the [first argument]([](https://github.com/joyent/node/blob/9010dd26529cea60b7ee55ddae12688f81a09fcb/lib/child_process.js#L430)\n). As stated in the docs:\n\n> There is a special case when sending a {cmd: 'NODE_foo'} message.\n\n Keep also  in mind that ipc calls are synchronous:\n\n> Please note that the send() method on both the parent and child are synchronous - sending large chunks of data is not advised (pipes can be used instead, see child_process.spawn).\n\nThen, I thought it could be nice to do:\n\n#### Child\n```javascript\nipc.send('started')\n```\n\n#### Master\n```javascript\nvar child = fork('child')\nchild.once('started', dosomething)\n```\n\nInternally I just had to combine EventEmitter and use the first argument to pass an array of arguments.\n\n## Usage\n\n### Server\n\n```javascript\n  var ipc = IPCEE(process)\n\n  ipc.send('started')\n\n  ipc.on('ping', function() {\n    ipc.send('pong') \n  })\n```\n\n### Client\n\n```javascript\n  var server = fork('some/node/app.js')\n  client = IPCEE(server)\n\n  client.once('started', function() {\n    client.send('ping')\n  })\n\n  client.once('pong', function() {\n    console.log('\\o/') \n  })\n```\n\n## Caveat\n\nUsing the first argument of [child_process.send()](https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html#child_process_child_send_message_sendhandle), Nodejs IPC will transport strings. Javascript objects are encoded with json internally. That said, You won't be able to pass instances.\n\nExample:\n```javascript\nprocess.on('uncaughtException', function(err) {\n  ipc.send('error', err.toString(), err.stack)\n\n  process.nextTick(function() {\n    process.exit(1) \n  })\n})\n```\n\nHere, Temptation would be to send the full Error object but `JSON.stringify(new Error('test')`) will return `'{}'`.\n\n### Licence\n\n> The MIT License (MIT)\n> \n> Copyright (c) 2015 Antoine Bluchet\n> \n> Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\n> of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\n> in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\n> to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\n> copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\n> furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n> \n> The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\n> all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n> \n> THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\n> IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\n> FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
