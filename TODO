- keep trash informations to restore
- copy/paste/move
- unrar => improve multiple

### Macro plugin :

#### Requirements :

- improve search filters through a schema, also allow -e for -exact or -d for -dir
- Add a file provider (refactor users db btw) for clipboard, macros

#### Add macro :

- generates an api address and a cron 
- stores last time update per user (file cache is better)
- hook on last items (maybe filters on the tree ? type filter, + tvshow / movie filter => through search)
- with last tree items :
  - call api things, like /p/unrar?path=path then /p/subtitles?path=path
  then /p/cut?path=x&type=movie && /p/paste?path=y&dest=x
  then notify new movies in x from last time update

remove macro, edit macro
